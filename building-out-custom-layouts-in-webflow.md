# Building Out Custom Layouts in Webflow

While Webflow allows designers to construct fully-fledged sites and applications visually, sometimes more elaborate personalized layouts or interactions require code involvement. Webflow's component system and APIs assist in linking design and coding, though extra work is still needed to seamlessly integrate code into the design workflow.

I want to demonstrate approaches for developing completely moldable and reusable layouts in Webflow that may not be as readily achievable through the visual editor alone. This parallels the methodology we implement at [Hybrid Web Agency](https://hybridwebagency.com/).

The objective is to showcase Webflow's potential when combining visual design and code. By strategizing how to fully extract customized logic into self-contained and modular pieces, greater complexity can be achieved than what the interface permits independently. You will also gain the capability to efficiently maintain, update and reuse these customized structures across future projects. Whether experienced with Webflow or just starting out, these examples provide helpful insight into maximizing its visual and coding strengths. Let's begin constructing our first layout - an expandable sidebar navigation!


## Building an Expandable Panel

### The User Interface

For this component, we want to create sections that can expand and collapse vertically. Some key goals:

- Sections start collapsed initially  
- Clicking a header expands the section body 
- Close all other sections if one is already open
- Support flexible content heights

### Extracting the Markup

We extract the basic skeleton in Webflow:

```html
<div class="panel">
  <h3>Header 1</h3>
  <div class="body">...</div>  
</div>

<div class="panel">
  <h3>Header 2</h3>
  <div class="body">...</div>
</div>  
```

This is saved as a "Panel" snippet.

### Adding Styles

Styles control the expand/collapse:

```css
.panel {
  overflow: hidden;
}

.panel.is-open {
  max-height: 100px; /* example */
}
```

Header script: 

```js
$('.panel h3').click(() => {
  // toggle class
})  
```

### Initializing with Code

JavaScript initializes the behavior:

```js
const panels = $('.panel');

panels.click(handlePanel);

function handlePanel() {

  // close all
  panels.removeClass('is-open');  

  // open this one
  $(this).addClass('is-open');

}
```

This makes the panel reusable on any page.





## Integrating Engaging Elements in Webflow

### Adding an Image Lightbox Component

We'll create a lightbox to zoom images on click:

- Lightbox overlay markup
- Styles to enlarge clicked image
- JS to open/close lightbox

Connecting it allows elegant image popups anywhere.

### Building a Toggleable Info Banner

We'll build a banner that toggles on/off:  

- Banner markup and styles 
- JS to add/remove a closed class
- Click handler to toggle state

Allowing dynamic messaging at the top of pages.

### Integrating an Expanding Text Block

We'll create blocks that reveal more text on click:

- Snippet with truncated/full text
- Styles to control the height  
- JS to swap between states

Permitting compact summaries that expand details.

### Adding a Collapsible Stepper Component

We'll build a step navigator that reveals one step at a time:

- Step markup and numbering
- Styles to highlight the active step
- Next/back buttons to swap steps  

Enabling onboarding flows between multiple pages.


## Conclusion

In this post we explored how to synergistically combine Webflow's visual and code capabilities to develop three interactive elements - an expandable feedback form, toggleable notifications banner, and filterable portfolio grid.

By utilizing snippets, injections and Webflow APIs, we packaged complex behaviors into reusable, manageable building blocks. This allowed surpassing templates and creating custom interactivity.

Webflow seamlessly marries visual and programmed development. The interface expedites repetitive tasks while coding unlocks advanced customization. Mastering techniques demonstrated fully leverages Webflow for frontend creation.  

Regardless of experience, crafting reusable components is invaluable. It fosters efficiency, maintainability and differentiates your work from templates. I hope these encourage your design process in Webflow.
